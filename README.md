A tool for analysing how one GPS path is compared to another.  The tool can be used online here: [GeoAnalyser](https://aljoni.github.io/p/geoanalyser).

Some example `line.gpx` and `track.gpx` files can be found in the root of this repository.

## Help Wanted

This tool is looking for developers, if you have the skills to:

* Test JavaScript applications
* Optimise code
* Work with GPS coordinates accurately

Then please feel free to fork this repository, fix issues, and make a pull request.  I am however quite busy at the
moment with university, so please be patient as I will probably not respond to pull requests immediately.
